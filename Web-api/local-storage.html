     //IndexedDB is a client-side database that lets you store and retrieve data locally, across multiple tabs and windows.
     
     //It's used when you need a more robust and complex database that needs to persist even after the page has been closed.
     
     //It's more complex to use and requires more code to manage, but it offers more control over the data.
     
     //IndexedDB is supported in all major browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
